# TE_Module2Capstone
Application developed in a team as part of coursework at Tech Elevator Coding Bootcamp

Command line front-end and server application developed to reinforce and demonstrate MVC design pattern and OOP principles. 

TEnmo is an application meant to mimic the popular money-transfer app, Venmo.
This project is comprised of a command-line front-end, SQL database, and a Java-run back-end server with an API.

From the command-line client, a user can register, which saves their username to the database and populates an account for them with 1000 TE Bucks.

A registered user can log in. 

A logged-in user can:
- view all registered users
- view their account balance
- send Bucks to a user (provided they have enough money in a single account to make the requested transfer)
- view all transactions they have been involved in
- view any transfer if they know and enter the transfer's ID number
- request money from a user
- view their pending sent/received transfer requests
